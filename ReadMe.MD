# Groups

Groups are created in config.yml, every group has a regular name, 
a fancy name, its authority, and its corresponding permissions.
The groups fancy name is what will be shown above the players
name and in chat. The permissions are what permissions the player
will receive when they are set into the group. 

Players can be in more than one group, they will inherit permissions
from every group they are in. The tag used above their name and chat
will come from the group that has highest authority.
